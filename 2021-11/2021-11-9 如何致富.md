（有个年轻的股东问查理要怎样才能追随他的足迹，查理的回答折服了在场的所有人）

许多年轻的生意人都问我们这个问题。这是一个聪明的问题：你看见某个有钱的老头，然后问他：“我怎样才能变的像你一样？”

**每天起床的时候，争取变得比你从前更聪明一点。**认真的，出色的完成你的任务。慢慢的，你会有所进步。但这种进步不一定会很快。但你这样能够为快速进步打好基础……每天慢慢的向前挪一点。到最后——如果你足够长寿的话——大多数人得到了他们应得的东西。

### 避免欠债

你一旦走进负债的怪圈，就很难走出来，千万别欠信用卡的钱。你无法在支付18%利息的情况下取得进展。

### How to get rich

> From Poor Charlie's Book

(A young shareholder asked Charlie what it would take to follow in his footsteps, and Charlie's answer convinced everyone in the room)

Many young business people ask us this question. It's a smart question: you see a rich old man and ask him, "How can I become like you?"

**Strive to get up every day and become a little smarter than you were. **Seriously and brilliantly complete your tasks. Slowly, you'll make progress. But that progress won't necessarily be fast. But you'll be able to lay the groundwork for rapid progress this way ...... Move forward a little more slowly each day. At the end of the day - if you live long enough - most people get what they deserve.

### Avoid getting into debt

> From Poor Charlie's Book

Once you walk into a circle of debt, it's hard to get out. Don't ever owe money on a credit card. You can't get ahead while paying 18% interest.
